Welcome to the Airbnb Pricing Consultation Project, a data-driven approach to help Airbnb hosts in the Los Angeles region optimize their listing prices. In this repository, we utilize Python's powerful capabilities and regression analysis to solve real-world problems for our clients.

## Project Overview

### Objective
As Airbnb consultants, we understand the importance of setting the right price for your property. Inaccurate pricing can lead to missed opportunities or revenue loss. Our goal is to provide data-backed insights to help hosts maximize their earnings.

### Key Features
- Data Extraction: We collect publicly available data from Airbnb listings in the Los Angeles region.
- Data Cleaning: We meticulously clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- Regression Analysis: We employ regression models to predict optimal pricing based on various factors such as location, property type, amenities, and historical booking data.
- Score-Based Analysis: We calculate regression scores to quantify the accuracy of our pricing recommendations.
